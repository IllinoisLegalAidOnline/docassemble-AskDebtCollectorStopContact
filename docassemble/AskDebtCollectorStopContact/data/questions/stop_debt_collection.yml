  Ask debt collector to stop contact
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Ask debt collector to stop contact** Easy Form.

  This program creates a letter to ask a debt collector to stop contacting you.

  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) gives you the right to stop a debt collector or collection agency from contacting you.

  Even if a debt collector stops contacting you, the debt is still there. The debt collector can sue you in court to collect the debt.
  
  Learn more about [**debt collection and your rights**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/my-rights-under-fair-debt-collection-practices-act).
